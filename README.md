# Fission

A custom ProjectKorra addon ability that creates a devastating two-pronged fire attack with delayed detonation mechanics.

## Overview

Fission fires twin projectiles that spread outward in a curved pattern, marking any entities they encounter. Once targets are marked, the user can detonate all marked entities simultaneously for massive area damage.

## How It Works

**Activation**: Left-click to launch the attack
**Detonation**: Sneak while targets are marked to trigger the explosion

The ability launches two fire projectiles that curve outward from each other as they travel, creating a wider area of effect at maximum range. Any living entities caught within the projectiles' hitbox become marked with a special effect.

Marked entities:
- Can be detonated instantly by sneaking for full damage
- Automatically lose their mark after the duration expires
- Display visual and audio indicators while marked

## Features

- **Twin Projectile System**: Two synchronized fire streams that link at a certain point
- **Mark & Detonate Mechanics**: Strategic gameplay with delayed gratification
- **Visual Effects**: Custom particles and sound effects for feedback
- **Configurable Settings**: Fully customizable damage, range, duration, and spread

## Configuration

All aspects are configurable including projectile range, damage values, mark duration, spread distance, projectile speed, and hitbox size.
